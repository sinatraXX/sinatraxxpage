    description: "Within our first week of this semester, we were asked to build a simple TCP Client and Server that can communicate with each other. This program is intended to be one of our learning projects in order to explore more on socket programming with python. I managed to learn python and began to use the available resources that I could get in order to make this program.",

    title: 'Simple Sniffer',
    description:"Our lecturer asked us to build a sniffer that able to listen to every communication that's been made on the computer. Since this project is a part of a guided self-learning class, I managed to use the provided resources to learn how to build a simple sniffer myself. I know this program is too simple and I'm not quite satisfied with it yet. So, I will actively keep improving and post my updates here!",
